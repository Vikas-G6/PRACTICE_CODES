    <p style="text-align: justify;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Masala Dosa Recipe | Crispy Masale Dose | How to make Masala Dosa
        with step-by-step photo and video recipe. south
        indian recipes are known for healthy and steamed rice-based breakfast recipes. these generally fall into either
        the dosa or idli category which in turn has many varieties with subtle variations. under the dosa category, the
        most popular variation is masala dosa or locally known as masale dose served with a choice of coconut chutney
        and spicy sambar.
        Well, there is a great story about the origin of the famous masale dosa. There are many stories around india,
        but according to the wiki, it originated from my hometown udupi. it was here in udupi, the dosa’s were made
        crisp and served. one of the local restaurants in udupi started to serve potato masala stuffed dosa as a
        variation and also to lower the coconut chutney consumption. in those days, coconut-based dishes were considered
        pricey and dosa’s cannot be consumed without any side dish. gradually stuffed dosa became one of the norms and
        the migrant community took this variety to mumbai and exposed it to a broader audience. it was very well
        received in the cosmopolitan city and that’s how it became one of the popular dose varieties.
